# Biking to Epicodus
### _The story of missing my exit._

Today, I gave myself **30 minutes** to get to class, for a bicycle ride that is only supposed to take **15 minutes**. I managed to miss the correct street to cross the Burnside bridge. Moving forward, here are the directions to get to class:


1. Go west on SE Pine Street toward SE 20th Ave
2. Turn left onto SE Sandy Blvd
3. Continue onto SE Madison street
4. Writing these directions is getting boring...

### The _main_ lesson I learned is that I should give myself more time when riding to class, and also turn up the volume on google maps so I can hear what the map lady is saying!

## Additionally, now that I've done the trip once and will be returning the way I came, next Monday should be _much_ easier!
